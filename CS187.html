            <h1>Starting With The Basics</h1>
            <p>Throughout the course of this seminar we learned about the basics of web design starting with the basic formatting of html. For example we can change the colors and fonts of the text as well as the size. In this case i'm using an external css file to do so.</p>

            <h2>Creating A Layout</h2>
            <p>We can also change the layout of our webpage by breaking it up into different parts called, <b><i>Sections</i></b>, <b><i>Articles</i></b>, <b><i>Headers</i></b>, <b><i>Footers</i></b>, and <b><i>Asides</i></b>, and sometimes a <b><i>Nav</i></b>. In this I used divisions to break the page into 2 columns. I also used a header and a footer.  </p>

            <h3>Making Use Of Images</h3>
            <p>We can also insert images into our code and us formatting to give it the right dimensions. For example you can see the beginning of my css file below.</p>
            <img src="Pictures/Screen%20Shot%202020-12-21%20at%2010.56.28%20AM.png" height="400" width="400" />
